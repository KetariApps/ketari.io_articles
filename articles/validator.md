## An AI Tool to Validate Your Idea

### Overview

As a company, Ketari recognizes the importance of effectively communicating our ideas and hypotheses to external stakeholders such as investors or potential partners. To make our ideas more compelling, we know we need to present them in a logical and easily understandable way.

We began by using ChatGPT to analyze our ideas and generate logical arguments by breaking down our hypotheses into premises and testing the assumptions of those premises. While this approach proved effective, we found the process to be repetitive and time-consuming.
To improve the consistency and quality of the results, we developed a tool that streamlines the process and can handle various types of ideas, hypotheses, and assertions. Weâ€™re currently working on the product and plan to launch an open beta in the next few weeks. Here is an example of the input and output you can expect from our tool:

### Input

> Adding a new product category to our portfolio will lead to increased market share and revenue.

### Output

> New product category:

> Adding a new product category to our portfolio will lead to increased market share and revenue.

> Assumptions:

> The hypothesis assumes there is significant market demand for the new product category. If this demand exists, it is likely to lead to increased market share and revenue. However, it is necessary to conduct market research in order to determine whether there is demand for the new product category.

> Recommendation: Conduct a survey of people within the target market to determine their interest in the new product category. Although the survey may not be completely representative of the entire target market, it would significantly increase the likelihood of identifying market demand.

> The hypothesis assumes the competition does not already offer a similar product category. If the competition already offers a similar product category, it could make it more difficult to gain market share and revenue. However, it is necessary to research the competition to determine if they already offer the new product category.

> Recommendation: Research the competition to determine if they already offer a similar product category. Although competitor research may not be perfect, it is likely to identify whether the competition already offers a similar product category.

> The hypothesis assumes the costs of producing the new product category are compatible with the intended retail price. If the cost of producing the new product category is too high, it may not lead to increased revenue and market share since it would be challenging to price it accordingly. However, it is necessary to research the production costs of the new product category and if they are compatible with the intended retail price.

> Recommendation: Set up a trial production of the new product category and determine the associated production costs. While a trial production may not be completely representative of the actual production of the entire product category, it would significantly increase the likelihood of identifying the production cost.

> The hypothesis assumes effective marketing will be utilized to promote the new product category. If effective marketing is utilized, there may be an increase in sales and revenue as people will be aware of the new product category. However, assumptions cannot be made about the effectiveness of future marketing efforts.

> Recommendation: Conduct a study on marketing strategies that have been effective in similar industries and develop a plan. Although determining the effectiveness of marketing strategies may not be possible, researching similar examples can lead to creating a well-informed marketing plan.
