# The Journey to Ketari: Motivation and Team Dynamics

So here I'm going to be writing a series of essays on team and motivation. Here's one about my journey as an Olympian and experiences we've had in the last year here at Ketari.

## The Appeal of Small and Medium Businesses

Most of the small and medium businesses that other startups are targeting seem to be in the 10-50 employees range. Why is that? Well, the organizational structure lends itself to growth. You have clear decision makers and there's not a lot of bureaucracy to get something done in an organization with 10 employees. If you have 10 employees, you're making enough money to afford to pay for a lot of the services that startups are offerin. You might even have a hair on fire problem. And why that's important for this essay is it relates to motivation. A lot of times we have obstacles as small businesses. And we might not know actually how much these obstacles are costing us.

### Outside Perspective and Priorities

In the words of a marketing expert, sometimes you just need someone from outside the organization to come in, take a look at everything and give you a best in class solution.

Those that are operating in the business day to day might spend too much on something as simple as the background color of the website. The background color of the website is not important compared to any of the other things that might be on your to-do list. However, it might be difficult to solve that simple question in an easy and quick way.

## Ketari's Motivation for Small Teams

At Ketari, we have a three-person team, and we are building systems and processes to solve obstacles that occur. The upfront implementation takes time; implementation takes, in some cases, money. But by paying it upfront, later on, at the margin, the cost is less, and that's what we're trying to do: build a greater margin because we know that for the lifetime of the business, small changes in this will have great value adds for the owners of the business and ultimately as a business person thatâ€™s the goal.

### Two Week Sprint and AI Integration

One process that we've used is the two-week sprint. Because of our experience as software engineers, we've applied Agile methodologies to all of our business. We know that revenue is the key metric that we're chasing, but we are brought together to follow one simple proverb: build cool stuff. How can the mundane and the tedious, the stuff that other people don't want to do, be cool? How can it be interesting for us? If we can build it in a system, if we can build it in a process and automate it, it is really cool. And that is inherent in who we are.

## The Future of AI and Automation

We're finally at a place and a time in the world, in which this is true. I think I saw that 1000 startups in the last month have had AI as the appendage in their title. And what does it mean to be AI? Even the simple algorithm can be AI; anything that accomplishes a task without me doing it for myself is artificial intelligence. But really, the pie in the sky, the moon shots are things that amaze us, things that we couldn't believe could be accomplished. Like chatgpt, right? Give me a process, and with this button, it is solved and done for me exactly how I want, and we're close to that future. In fact, I believe that it's happening now. It's happening at a speed that is amazing.
